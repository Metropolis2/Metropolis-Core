# Introduction

*THIS DOCUMENTATION IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS, MANY CHAPTERS ARE STILL EMPTY*

## Metropolis

Metropolis is an agent-based transport simulator.

Its main features are:

- Mode choice (with an arbitrary number of modes, road vehicles are explicitly modeled)
- Continuous-time departure-time choice
- Deterministic route choice (for road vehicles)
- Agent based (each agent is an autonomous entity with its own characteristics and choices)
- Modeling of road congestion (using speed-density functions and bottlenecks)
- Intermediary stops (with schedule preferences and stopping time at each intermediary point)

## What is this book?

This is the official documentation of Metropolis.
It is designed to store everything there is to know on Metropolis, including
- [How to use it?]()
- [What are its theoretical foundations?]()
- [How it is built?]() 
- [What are the tools associated with Metropolis?](tools/index.html)
- [How to contribute]()
